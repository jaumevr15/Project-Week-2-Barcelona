## Project Description
At times where Climate Change headlines are more common than ever, this project intends to provide real and acurate data analysis to answer questions regarding climate change happening in Barcelona City. This project uses data available from Open Data BCN.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The main question of this project is: Is Climate Change happenning in Barcelona?
We consider climate change happening if there is an increase of temperature above of 1,5ºC in a period of 100 years. This is the reference the Paris Agreement uses to control the increase of temperature in Planet Earth (1,5ºC in the XXI Century as a limit).
But in order to answer this question, the project opens more specific questions:
- Has the temperature increased in Barcelona in the last 200 years?
- There is indeed a gap between years, can we confirm the increase is higher in the last years?
- Are recent years having more extreme temperatues between seasons?

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
We used the 'Monthly average air temperatures of the city of Barcelona since 1780' from Open Data BCN.
https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/temperatures-hist-bcn
It is a single chart which shows every monthly average temperature since 1780.

## Workflow
1. First brainstorming to identify questions about Barcelona we would like to answer.
2. Found common topics to analyze, then checked on available databases to confirm the topic of the project.
3. Approach and definition of the main question the project is about.
4. Research to evaluate which variables and conditions used to respond to that question.
5. Data first screening and planning of how to approach both questions and datasets to start the analysis.
6. Division of main question into a few smaller ones to approach the analysis from different scopes.
7. First lines of code using Pandas. First data manipulation.
8. First outputs and relative answers. Re-check of current questions and adaptation of them according to first results.
9. Code development. First main challenges appeared when handling and organizing data.
. Useful output discovered, analysis and observations start.
10. Slides and readme development summing up the questions, outputs and results.
11. Files and project final check.

## Organization
Our work was organized through Trello which allowed us to set, organize and allocate the different tasks and to-do's of the project. We could add useful links, resources and set deadlines to know what to prioritize.

The project main code and data manipulation is hosted into the main.ipynb file.
The project includes two complementary code:
- slides_code.ipynb: Especific code applied to charts in main.ipynb to get specific output for the presentation.
- annex.ipynb: Trial code used in some of the operations that did not completely work or reached the needed output.

It also includes two DataSets, which contain the same information in two different formats:
- temperaturesbarcelonadesde1780.csv
- temperaturesbarcelonadesde1780_format_long.csv

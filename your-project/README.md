## Project Description
At times where Climate Change headlines are more common than ever, this project intends to provide real and acurate data analysis to answer questions regarding climate change happening in Barcelona City. This project uses data available from Open Data BCN.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The main question of this project is: Is Climate Change happenning in Barcelona?
We consider climate change happening if there is an increase of temperature above of 1,5ºC in a period of 100 years. This is the reference the Paris Agreement uses to control the increase of temperature in Planet Earth (1,5ºC in the XXI Century as a limit).
But in order to answer this question, the project opens more specific questions:
- Has the temperature increased in Barcelona in the last 200 years?
- There is indeed a gap between years, can we confirm the increase is higher in the last years?
- Are recent years having more extreme temperatues between seasons?

## Dataset
What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
We used the 'Monthly average air temperatures of the city of Barcelona since 1780' from Open Data BCN.
https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/data/en/dataset/temperatures-hist-bcn
It is a single chart which shows every monthly average temperature since 1780.
